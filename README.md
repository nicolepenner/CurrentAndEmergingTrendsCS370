### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The goal for this project is to use Python, TensorFlow, Keras libraries. The agent's goal is to move up, down, left, and right through the environment. The maze is defined as a matrix, and a reward is given based on position of the agent - this code was given to me. The code was also given to me for "experience for replay." This allows the game to store episodes, and all the states between initial and terminal state. This is what will be used for the agent to learn in the future states. I was also given the build model code which is used to build the neural network. I had the skeleton of the Q-Training Algorithm, but I had to write the bulk of it - and the goal of the code is find the best navigation path to the end. I was give the play game code, this ensures the agent does have a path to win.


### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science: What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists use technology to help solve problems. They also may write and program software for applications. Typically, computer scientists are more interested in the theoretical aspects of computers - but they can do both. Since we live in a digital age where most of us rely on technology to function on a daily basis - computer scienctists have a critical role. Computer scientists are important in scientific research, health, transport, banking, AI, communication, and even everyday life for the general population. Computer science is important to continue to grow software to help industries that use technology, as well as technology we use to function everyday. For us to continue on an upward trajectory for progress in the digital age we're in, Computer Scientists will be key. 

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

From my understanding, the core ideology of computer science is problem solving. To successfully program, it is useful to first think about how a human would solve the problem, and then think about and decide how to translate that process into an algorithm. That algorithm represents how the computer will solve the problem, even though sometimes that may be different than how humans will solve a problem since AI isn't quite caught up with human thinking yet. The first consideration for problem solving is to think logically, and break the problem down into easier steps that can be solved. A first consideration would be how to represent the data of the problem, then write out the steps of what the alogorithm needs to accomplish. 


### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My responsibilities as a computer scientist to the end user is to first and foremost respect their privacy. This includes not misusing their information that my program or application uses, and to keep that information secure. I also have a responsibility to be honest, trustworthy, honor confidentiality, avoid harming others, and contribute positively to soceity. I also have the responsibility to be transparent with users. My responsibilities to my organization is also the same as to users, but also that my work is my own and I do uphold the highest level of integrity. For my organization, it is my responsibility to comply with all regulations of ethics.
