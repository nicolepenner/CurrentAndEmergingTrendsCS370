### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The goal for this project is to use Python, TensorFlow, Keras libraries. The agent's goal is to move up, down, left, and right through the environment. The maze is defined as a matrix, and a reward is given based on position of the agent - this code was given to me. The code was also given to me for "experience for replay." This allows the game to store episodes, and all the states between initial and terminal state. This is what will be used for the agent to learn in the future states. I was also given the build model code which is used to build the neural network. I had the skeleton of the Q-Training Algorithm, but I had to write the bulk of it - and the goal of the code is find the best navigation path to the end. I was give the play game code, this ensures the agent does have a path to win.

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
